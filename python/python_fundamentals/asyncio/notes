idk if this is concepetually right but:

async & await was intro-ed in python 3.5
goal was to simplify writing code that perform IO bound ops (web reqs, file ops, DB queries) without bottlenecking the program exeec

allows program to "pause" & yield control back to the event loop while waiting for IO operations to ocmplete

handles numerous tasks in a single thread

-----------
Asyncio > thread
so is the benefit of using asyncio that,
if i want to run my thread then i have a http req to send out, yet i want to continue executing some other routine on my thread without giving up this current thread (since python is single threaded execution) then thats when i use asyncio?


Exactly! You’ve got it right. The main benefit of using asyncio is that it allows you to continue running other routines while waiting for tasks like HTTP requests, database queries, or file I/O to complete—all on the same thread.

- asyncio generally use less resources as it operates on a single thread & avoids overhead associated with thread mgmt & context switching
    large number of async tasks can still introduce its own complexities => need to mange event loop & coroutines

- Threads consume more resources due to context switching & mgmt of multiple threads => resource consumption can be significant (esply in CPU bound scenarios where the GIL limits the effective parallelism)

Thread > asyncio
1. when working with blocking IO operations that dont support async calls (i.e. sync web reqs, sync DB queries, read & write file etc.)
* coz then the execution will not yield and just become slow (synchronous again)

2. when you want another thread to run while waiting for this IO execution to be done, rather than continuing with this current thread

-----------
main benefits:
1. IO operations => asyncio

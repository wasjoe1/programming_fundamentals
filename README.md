This repository contains my understanding of language specific programming fundamental concepts, data structures & algorithms.

As I'm growing as a developer, I have come to realise that understanding the underlying implementations of
the tools I am using is crucial when making efficient & scalable apps. This has genuinely peaked my interest as
I find myself thinking questions such as "how does the sort() work in python? does it truly use merge sort?"
This has incentivised me to implement certain parts of mentioned concepts, write out algorithms that are used
in the langauge and implement data structures to better understand how they work under the hood.

Though arguably I could just read documentations to understand how they work, I believe that writing them
out will help me to understand the smallest of details that could be overlooked and to solidify my understanding
of the concepts, algorithms & data structures. I will be able to understand what is crucial of these through
trial and error, and make better decisions when efficiency & scalability issues arise in my projects in the future.

Though not 1 of the goals, I might also have the chance to see if there are better implementations such that I can
employ them in my projects.
